# RSA SecurRPG Rules

## Intro

As a software developer, I've spent a long part of my life carrying a [security token](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token) around. I done that even before I had a portable device capable of run any kind of game, so on my free time in the cold depths of datacenters, I had to find something to amuse myself. This game was one of the things I toyed with.

Now I have a computer in my pocket that is more powerful then the servers I worked on at time, but I keep coming back to the game. The fact I can play it anywhere, with only the token, pen and paper really resonates with me.


## Components

* A [RSA SecurID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SecurID) or any device that can generates random-ish six digit numbers. Six dices with different colors works too.
* Paper for the character sheet
* Pen
* This rules document

## Preparations

In a page of paper, write the following fields. I use a ruled notebook and add each item in a different row.

Name:
HP: 150
Level: 1
Coins: 0
XP: 0
To Level: 100

Pick a character name you like and enter in the first row. After this, leave the rest of the page for the items you may purchase from the shop. You are now ready to start.

## How to play the game

Each turn, you have a free action and an event resolution. Free actions available are shop and use item, while the only event type available is combat. More will be added later.

The free action happens first and its optional, while event resolution is required. We are going to talk about the event resoltion first.

### Event resolution (Combat)

After doing your optional free action, look at the token and write down the six digit number you see there. Each one of the digits represents something in the combat.

1st digit - the kind of monster you are fighting with. Check the monster table
2nd digit - monster's attack value
3rd digit - your character's attack value
4th digit - the damage your character will take if the monster win this turn
5th digit - number of coins you will win if you kill the monster and loot him
6th digit - not used yet

####  Event rules

* Compare your attack with the monster's. If yours is higher, you killed him. Otherwise, you take the damage defined by the 4th digit. If the damage is zero, you take one point of damage. The monster then vanishes into the darkness.
* If you kill the monster, you get the difference between your attack value and the monster's as experience points (multiplied by two).
* You loot the number of coins defined by the 5th digit. If the number is zero, you loot one coin. Increment your total coins by this number.

### Free actions

#### Shop

You can use your coins to buy items from the shop table. You can buy as many items you want, as long you can afford them.

#### Use item

You can use any items you have in the same free action.
